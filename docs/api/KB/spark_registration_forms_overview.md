# Registration Forms Overview

Registration forms are the key to collecting and managing your leads in Spark. Setting up your registration form is simple, but there are a few steps to follow in order to maximize the benefits Spark can provide.

**Access Requirements:** The ability to view and modify registration forms is restricted to users with a permission level of Manager or Administrator.

## Registration Form Types

There are three registration form types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Web Registration** | Used for website registration forms. This type of form is often left unstyled in Spark and incorporated on the website by a web developer using the custom registration form code. |
| **On-Site** | Used for onsite registration forms. This type of form is often styled in Spark and displayed on a tablet (or a visitor's own device, via a link displayed as a QR code) at the sales centre. |
| **Survey** | Used for general purchaser or agent surveys. This type of form is often styled in Spark and emailed to contacts via a link. |

## Implementation Options

Common use cases for each registration form type are described above, but each type can be used with:
- URL/link embed code
- iframe embed code  
- Custom registration form code

This flexibility allows you to match your unique use case.

## Accessing Registration Forms

To view the registration forms page, go to **Menu → Forms → List**.

This page displays:
- A list of any existing registration forms of that type you may have

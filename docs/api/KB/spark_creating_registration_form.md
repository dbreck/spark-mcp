# Creating a New Registration Form

Create customized registration forms to match your branding and desired user experience. For maximum utility, there are three ways to use a Spark registration form: link to the Spark-hosted form, Iframe or a custom registration form.

## Getting Started

To create a new registration form, navigate to the appropriate forms page (**Menu → Forms → List**) and click the **New Form** button to access a version of Carpenter specific to registration forms. 

See [Registration Forms Overview](https://knowledge.spark.re/registration-forms-overview) for a description of common use cases for each form type if you're unsure which to choose.

The settings modal is the first page you are asked to complete, but you can always edit the settings after the form has been created if you don't have all of the details yet. Read more about registration form settings [here](https://knowledge.spark.re/registration-form-settings).

## Sections

By default, a new registration form contains a photo section, first name and email fields, an agent determiner, a brokerage field, a Submit button and a disclaimer. The default form requires only the email address be completed in order to submit the form, but you can customize not only which demographic fields to include but also which of these fields should be mandatory.

The following sections are available to add to the registration form:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Photo** | Spans the width of the form and provides space to add a banner image such as a project logo, rendering or header. Drag and drop the desired image file into the photo widget. |
| **Text** | Spans the width of the form. Add a project description or any other information that might benefit your registrants. |
| **Contact Info** | Registrant demographics. Click to select which fields to include (must include email). Once the section has been added to the form, you can choose which fields to make mandatory and toggle them to full or half width. You can also rearrange the order of the fields. |
| **Questions** | Select the project questions to add to the form, or create a new one. You can rearrange the order of the questions once the section has been added to the form. |
| **Agent** | Registrants who answer "Yes" to this question are assigned the default 'Agent' rating that you set in the registration forms settings and are given the agent tag. If you chose a follow up schedule for agents, it is also automatically applied. |
| **Comments** | Include this widget to leave an open text area for a registrant to enter more information about themselves. Their response will be added to their profile in Spark as a note. |
| **Spacer** | Add a spacer section to add additional space between sections. |

## Customization

Once the desired sections have been added, the registration form can be further customized by rearranging the sections. Additionally, though the button is a required feature of the registration form, its appearance can be adjusted by clicking on it. 

Finally, the disclaimer, while also a required feature, can be edited by clicking on it. By default, the disclaimer will be the one that was created in the project's [email settings](https://knowledge.spark.re/email-settings).

When the registration form is complete, click the **Preview** button to see how the form displays on desktop and mobile devices.

## Embed Options

There are three different ways to embed your registration form. To view these options on the registration forms page, click the micromenu for the appropriate form and select **Embed Options**. Alternatively, open the form in Carpenter and click **Embed Options** in the menu on the left.

### URL or Link Embed Code
Registrants will be directed to the Spark-hosted registration page and will see the registration form as it appears using the Preview button in Carpenter.

### Iframe Embed Code
Similar to the option above, but registrants will not be directed to a new page. Instead, the form, along with the style and formatting determined in Carpenter, are embedded within the existing site, placing it within the context of the project's branding.

### Custom Registration Form
For the greatest range of flexibility, use the custom registration form. This method requires you to send the raw code (which we provide) to your web developer to style entirely according to your specifications. 

For more information about custom registration forms, see the [Registration Form Developer Guide](https://knowledge.spark.re/registration-form-developer-guide).

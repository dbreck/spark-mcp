# Registration Forms Submissions Log

If a registration form is not submitting as expected, it may be useful to view the Registration Form Submissions Log to see what error is being reported for unsuccessful registration events. 

Go to **Menu → Forms → List**, then click **Form Submissions** to view the log. 

Each entry should contain the specific:
- Registration form name
- Registering email address  
- Registering IP address
- Timestamp
- Reported error(s) (if applicable)
